LizardBrain is the dumbest possible implementation of neural network as chess evaluation function

To work, it needs weights.bin in the same folder as the engine.

Strength is difficult to estimate: it scores close to even against Rodent 0.11, but gets slaughtered by Fruit more than a 2580ish engine would.
